Universal Clipboard & File Sharing App
======================================

A cross-platform application that synchronizes clipboard content and facilitates real-time file sharing across devices. The app supports Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android, with features like clipboard history, end-to-end encryption, and peer-to-peer file transfers.

**Vision**
----------

To provide a seamless, secure, and efficient way for users to copy, paste, and share files across devices and operating systems in real-time, enhancing productivity and connectivity.

**Technologies**
----------------

### **Frontend**

-   **Framework**: Next.js
    -   Used for building a responsive, high-performance user interface.
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
    -   Enables rapid development with a clean and modern design system.

### **Backend**

-   **Language**: Rust
    -   Core backend logic for security, performance, and P2P communication.
-   **Networking**:
    -   **WebRTC**: For peer-to-peer real-time communication.
    -   **libp2p**: Rust-native library for P2P networking (alternative to WebRTC).
-   **Server Framework**: Actix-web or Node.js (for WebRTC signaling and fallback services).

### **Cross-Platform Frameworks**

-   **Desktop**: Tauri
    -   Lightweight, efficient, and integrates with Rust for backend logic.
-   **Mobile**: Capacitor (by Ionic)
    -   Wraps web-based applications into native mobile apps for iOS and Android.

### **Real-Time Communication**

-   **WebSockets**: For clipboard sync and device status updates.
-   **TURN Servers**: For fallback in cases where direct P2P connections aren't possible.

### **Security**

-   **Encryption**: RustCrypto (AES-256) or WebCrypto APIs.
-   **Authentication**: OAuth, JWT, or QR code-based pairing.

### **Storage**

-   **Clipboard History**: SQLite or LocalStorage for lightweight data persistence.
-   **Cloud Backup (Optional)**: AWS S3, Firebase, or Supabase for cloud-based storage.

**Architecture**
----------------

1.  **Initialization**

    -   Devices pair using QR codes or secure links.
    -   Connections established via WebRTC/libp2p with signaling.
2.  **Clipboard Monitoring**

    -   Clipboard changes are detected using platform-specific APIs.
    -   Changes are encrypted and sent to connected devices.
3.  **Real-Time Synchronization**

    -   Clipboard data and files are synchronized in real-time using WebSockets or P2P tunnels.
    -   Files are shared via direct tunneling or optional relay servers.
4.  **User Interaction**

    -   Users interact with a unified UI to view clipboard history, manage shared files, and adjust settings.
